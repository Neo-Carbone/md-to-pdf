# Agentic Platform Discovery - Status Summary

**Project:** Emotion AI Agent Prototype  
**Date:** December 16, 2024  
**Prepared by:** Neo Carbone

---

## Objective

Build an agentic demo that demonstrates the value of your emotion detection technology.

The agent can deliver value in multiple ways:
- **Validate consistency** of model outputs across sessions
- **Prove signal quality** by showing models detect meaningful patterns
- **Generate insights** that transform raw emotion data into actionable recommendations
- **Feed data back** to improve models over time

---

## Where We Are

### Completed: Business Case Analysis

We evaluated four use cases. Based on alignment with your current work and value potential, we recommend focusing on two:

| Use Case | Recommendation | Primary Value | Why |
|----------|---------------|---------------|-----|
| **Job Interview Coach** | ✓ Top Candidate | Consistency validation + insights | Most mature, clear success metrics, aligned with current MVP |
| **Wellness Assistant** | ✓ Top Candidate | Signal quality proof + data generation | Strong proof that models detect real patterns |
| Health Clinic Triage | Defer | Reliability validation | Requires clinical context we don't have yet |
| Content Creator Insights | Defer | Signal quality at scale | Requires viewer opt-in infrastructure |

### Ready For: Use Case Selection

We have enough to select a use case and begin. To finalize, we need:

1. **Sensor/Data Source Inventory** - What signals can the agent cross-reference?
2. **Timeline Constraints** - Which use case is feasible given your deadlines?
3. **Success Definition** - What matters most to prove?

### Approach: Standalone First, Integration Later

The initial prototype can be standalone - working with Gemini, Deepgram, and available sensors to prove value. Deeper integration with the Human Context Engine and Model Garden comes in the "run phase."

## Recommended Use Cases

### Option 1: Job Interview Coach

**What the agent does:**
- Cross-references emotion output with behavioral signals (voice, eye tracking, motion)
- Flags inconsistencies ("model says stressed but signals look calm")
- Validates patterns across sessions ("consistent improvement over 3 practices")
- Generates coaching recommendations linked to resources

**Value surfaces:**
- Proves model consistency
- Transforms emotion data into user value
- Clear partnership hook (LinkedIn content integration)

**Timeline question:** December 22 MVP deadline - is there room for agent integration?

---

### Option 2: Wellness Assistant

**What the agent does:**
- Detects notable emotional moments throughout the day
- Correlates with context (calendar, time patterns, wearables)
- Prompts journaling at meaningful moments
- Proves models identify real patterns (not noise)

**Value surfaces:**
- Proves signal quality
- Generates training data through user feedback
- Potential partnership validation

**Timeline question:** What's the level of urgency here?

## What We Need From You

### 1. Sensor/Data Source Inventory
What did Monica's Spain team use? What's available via API?

### 2. Timeline Constraints
Which use case is feasible given your deadlines?

### 3. Success Definition
What matters most - consistency, signal quality, insights, training data, or partner impressions?

## Next Steps

| Step | Owner | Timeline |
|------|-------|----------|
| Complete questionnaire | Your team | Before next meeting |
| Finalize effort estimates | Neo Carbone | After receiving input |
| Use case selection | Both teams | Next meeting |
| Build demo | Both teams | Post-selection |

---

## The Outcome

This demo should prove:

1. **Your technology works** - Models produce consistent, meaningful signals
2. **There's product value** - Agents transform signals into user outcomes
3. **Partners can build on it** - Clear path from model output to valuable applications
